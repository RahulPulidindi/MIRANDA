Cop (00:04):
Maam I pulled you over today because your headlights are on. Can I search your car?

Victim (00:11):
No, I am not comfortable with that.

Cop (00:14):
Maam I'm asking you to operate, cooperate with me.

Jolie (00:17):
It is within my right to stay in my car.

Cop (00:19):
Maam, I am asking you the second time.

Jolie (00:22):
And I'm telling you, no, it's my rights.

Cop (00:25):
Maam I'm going to have to arrest you.

Jolie (00:27):
No one is arresting anybody. And I know my rights.

Cop (00:33):
We're going to, we're going to have to please step out of your car.

Jolie (00:36):
You do know I am recording this.
