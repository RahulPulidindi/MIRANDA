Maam I pulled you over today because your headlights are on. Can I search your car?
No, I am not comfortable with that.
Maam I'm asking you to operate, cooperate with me.
It is within my right to stay in my car.
Maam, I am asking you the second time.
And I'm telling you, no, it's my rights.
Maam I'm going to have to arrest you.
No one is arresting anybody. And I know my rights.
We're going to, we're going to have to please step out of your car.
You do know I am recording this.
